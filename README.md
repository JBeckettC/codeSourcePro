# The most advanced coding ever. Period.
This code is so advanced, you can't understand it!
So, let's get right in! Also, please feel free to fork this repo and say you made it to flex on your friends. [http://bitly.ws/3Vy7/](Learn More)


# What does it mean?
That's up for you to find out! To start, look at launchd.py, and then go from there. If you don't understand something that's there, don't worry! There is a 99.99% chance you are not alone. I don't even know what this means! And that probably says something. In fact, it *does* say something. Alright? So. Don't fret if you can't comprehend the sheer complexity of this code. Steve Jobs probably doesn't even know what it means! If me not knowing says something, than *that* **definately** says something. So, don't take it personally.

# Does it do anything?
No.

# Alright. What is the purpose?
`None. Absolutely none.`
